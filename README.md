# GA4_Ecommerce_Analysis
Analysis of User Engagement and other metrics based on ga4 obfuscated sample ecommerce data 

Project Description:
This project aims to analyze user engagement and conversion rates across different times of the day on an e-commerce platform. By understanding how user behavior varies throughout the day, the platform can optimize ad campaigns and content delivery schedules to maximize engagement and revenue.
Key Features:

Data Segmentation: The data is segmented into different times of the day, such as dawn, morning, afternoon, and night, to enable a granular analysis of user engagement patterns.
Engagement Metrics: The project analyzes various engagement metrics, including unique users, total events, session starts, purchases, total purchase value, add-to-cart actions, and engagement time.
Statistical Analysis: The project employs statistical tests such as the Shapiro-Wilk test, Levene's test, ANOVA, and the Kruskal-Wallis test to determine if there are significant differences in user engagement and conversion rates across the different time segments.
Data Visualization: The project utilizes data visualization techniques, including boxplots, line plots, and heatmaps, to effectively communicate the findings and provide insights into user behavior patterns.
Correlation Analysis: The project explores the correlations between different engagement metrics to identify potential relationships and dependencies.
Hypothesis Testing: The project tests the hypothesis that the time of day influences customer engagement behavior by conducting statistical tests on various engagement variables.
Non-Parametric Tests: In cases where the data does not meet the normality assumptions required for ANOVA, the project employs non-parametric tests such as the Kruskal-Wallis test to ensure the robustness of the analysis.

Technologies Used:

- Python
- Google BigQuery
- Pandas
- SciPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

Key Findings:

The analysis did not find statistically significant differences in user engagement and conversion rates across different times of the day for the analyzed variables.
The platform's user engagement appears to be stable throughout the day, suggesting that time alone may not be a significant factor influencing user behavior.
The project highlights the importance of conducting thorough statistical analysis and considering non-parametric tests when assumptions are violated.
